# IRIS
This project was designed to upgrade existing survaillence systems. The current survaillence systems are used as a passive resource for anamoly detection.
We have developed an AI powered algorithm for detecting such anamolies. This aims to eliminate the delay caused by human interaction as its not possible for a human to be actively monitoring every camera 24/7, however an AI can do that.

# TODO
 - [x]   Edit the current Readme to show progress
 - [ ]   Update docs for a more in depth view of the algorithm
 - [ ]   Improve Frontend
 - [ ]   Deploy  the algoritm
